            <h2><center>Greatest Discord Bot</center></h2>
            <p>
                I programmed a discord bot called “Greatest” whose primary function 
                was the moderation of discord servers and SQL databases. This project 
                started in January 2021 as a small pass time but quickly grew into an 
                opportunity to learn about a range of languages and refine my 
                problem-solving skills. The code is available 
                <a href = "https://github.com/MulaTheRadish/GreatestDiscordBot"> here</a>.

            <h2><center>Discord Webhook</center></h2>
            <p>
                Alongside the Discord Bot I had created, I programmed webhooks that 
                uploaded posts from subreddits to discord server channels through a 
                third-party website. The webhooks programmed in Javascript transformed 
                subreddit posts into embedded discord posts. Learning how to use 
                Javascript was a challenging experience that refined my problem-solving 
                and research skills.
